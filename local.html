        <h2>Local Solutions</h2>
        <p id="p1" style="color: white;">
            <b>SDG - 8</b><br>
            <b>Problem 1:</b><br>
            Tourism is facing unprecedented challenges. <br><br>
            <b>Short Term Solutions</b><br>
            Governments should provide economic aid and should work upon reviving tourism industry. States like Jammu
            and Kashmir need to be prioritied such that governments can improve the livelihoods of people. In states
            like these, the whole state economy is dependent upon tourism hence improving tourism could result in
            improving lives of people immensely. Governmets should work upon making a board that focuses on evaluating
            each state on the basis of the conditions prevelant there. As SDG warrior it is important to inform people
            about this and bring this solution in front of the government. <br><br>
            <b>Long Term Solutions</b><br>
            Educate people such that a tourist friendly community is formed. This will result in improving tourism
            drastically. As an SDG warrior we must work as a community to uplift the poor, keep our surroundings clean
            and promote our rich culture and tradition. While this may take time to implement it will surely be fruitful
            <b>Problem 2:</b><br>
            Psychological blow from COVID-19 has caused tremendous harm to Indian economy.<br><br>
            <b>Solutions:</b><br>
            As an SDG warrior we can design an app that has data base connected to various psychologists who can help these 
            people, and hence can uplift the productivity of people. We can also provide uplifting podcasts so that mental 
            traumas donâ€™t inhibit people to work at their best. We can also send teams to people who have used are solution 
            so that we can analyze if our solutions worked and how to make them optimized.
            <br><br>
            <b>SDG - 11</b><br>
            <b>Problem 1:</b><br>
            43 million tons per annum waste is generated in cities of India.<br><br>
            <b>Solutions:</b><br>
            As an SDG warrior we can work upon bringing up innovative solution to curb waste generation and reuse it in a 
            different and better way. We can collaborate with small startups and focus on promoting them, so that these starts 
            turn out to be game changers.
            <b>Problem 2:</b><br>
            Only 31% of people live in urban areas.<br><br>
            <b>Solutions:</b><br>
            As an SDG warrior we can work upon educating people regarding this and asking the government to use land and convert 
            them from urban areas to rural areas. We can introduce technologies so that they can connect with the fast-paced 
            digital world which will eventually lead to that area being urban.
