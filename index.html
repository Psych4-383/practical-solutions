                Finding Problems and their solutions by innovation has become human's second nature. Solutions are only
                decent when they are practically possible and scalable. But to find those solutions, problems need to be
                identified, and hence, we have divided the problems and classified them as either, local problems (where
                people have a major role to play for the fulfillment of the solution) and global problems, (where
                governments of different countries need to take action as individual personâ€™s work would be
                insignificant). Analyzing and understanding this would lead to solving most of our problems.
                <br><br>
                SDG-8 states that we should promote sustainable economic rise. This is an issue which has to be solved
                at multiple fronts, many local problems and major global problems.
                <br><br>
                SDG-11 states, we should move towards sustainable cities and communities.
                <br><br>
                In both these SDGs we can identify the fact that the concept of "sustainability" is prevalent. Hence our
                solutions must be in line with the expectations of the question too.
                <br><br>
                A major problem, affecting the goals of both SDGs is global collaboration which can be achieved only but
                commitment and determination to fulfill it. Global collaboration will also dictate the solutions
                proposed.
                <br><br>
                For the purpose of the solutions, we would consider full global support considering that this problem
                affects each and every person be it of any country. Hence keeping in mind these pointers we will be
                moving on to the solutions.
