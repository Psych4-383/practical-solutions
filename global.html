        <h2>Global Solutions</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            Solutions to global problems need huge support from governments and countries to facilitate them. Hence,
            global problems and solutions need years, even decades to get implemented. <br> <br>
            <b>SDG-8</b><br> 
            <b>Problem 1:</b><br>
            During the pandemic 1.6 billion workers in the economy risk losing their livelihoods. <br><br>
            <b>Short Term Solutions</b> <br>
            Governments around the world, should prioritize the vaccination of these people and should work upon giving
            them economic aid. As an SDG warrior we must gather together, and demand the government to register them,
            such that the government schemes benefit them. <br><br>
            <b>Long Term Solutions</b><br>
            Governments should work upon improving the working conditions of people. It should train people and "kill"
            menial jobs and should introduce new jobs with better scope of work. Being an SDG warrior we must look that
            how we can help in implementing this solution. We should work upon gathering funds for the same and okay a
            major role in widening their skill sets <br><br><br>
            <b>Problem 2:</b><br>
            Tourism is facing unprecedented challenges. <br><br>
            <b>Short Term Solutions</b><br>
            Governments should provide economic aid and should work upon  reviving tourism industry. States like Jammu and Kashmir need to be prioritied such that governments can improve the livelihoods of people. In states like these, the whole state economy is dependent upon tourism hence improving tourism could result in improving lives of people immensely. Governmets should work upon making a board that focuses on evaluating each state on the basis of the conditions prevelant there. As SDG warrior it is important to inform people about this and bring this solution in front of the government. <br><br>
            <b>Long Term Solutions</b><br>
            Educate people such that a tourist friendly community is formed. This will result in improving tourism drastically.
