        <h2>Global Solutions</h2>
        <p id="p1"  style="color: white;">
            Solutions to global problems need huge support from governments and countries to facilitate them. Hence,
            global problems and solutions need years, even decades to get implemented. <br> <br>
            <b>SDG-8</b><br> 
            <b>Problem 1:</b><br>
            During the pandemic 1.6 billion workers in the economy risk losing their livelihoods. <br><br>
            <b>Short Term Solutions</b> <br>
            Governments around the world, should prioritize the vaccination of these people and should work upon giving
            them economic aid. As an SDG warrior we must gather together, and demand the government to register them,
            such that the government schemes benefit them. <br><br>
            <b>Long Term Solutions</b><br>
            Governments should work upon improving the working conditions of people. It should train people and "kill"
            menial jobs and should introduce new jobs with better scope of work. Being an SDG warrior we must look that
            how we can help in implementing this solution. We should work upon gathering funds for the same and okay a
            major role in widening their skill sets <br><br><br>
            <b>Problem 2:</b><br>
            Slowdown in Global Economic Growth <br><br>
            <b>Short Term Solutions</b><br>
            We as sdg warriors need to work upon developing a system that will enable people to increase their skill set hence increasing their productivity. We must also educate people regarding how taking short naps can help tremendously in productivity. We must start with neighborhoods and work our way forward to larger areas. <br><br>
            <b>Long Term Solutions</b><br>
            The major problem is global education system and its ridgity. We must improve the way, in which people percieve the education system. We,  as SDG warriors must inform this to the public and to the world such that as per country education system can be customized. While in many countries it is in practice, in majority countries it is not. This will result in our next generation being more productive and skillful.
