                During the pandemic 1.6 billion workers in the economy risk losing their livelihoods. <br><br>

                <b>Short Term Solutions</b> <br>
                Governments around the world, should prioritize the vaccination of these people and should work upon
                giving
                them economic aid. As an SDG warrior we must gather together, and demand the government to register
                them,
                such that the government schemes benefit them. <br><br>

                <b>Long Term Solutions</b><br>
                Governments should work upon improving the working conditions of people. It should train people and
                "kill"
                menial jobs and should introduce new jobs with better scope of work. Being an SDG warrior we must look
                that
                how we can help in implementing this solution. We should work upon gathering funds for the same and okay
                a
                major role in widening their skill sets <br><br><br>

                <b>Short Term Solutions</b><br>
                We as sdg warriors need to work upon developing a system that will enable people to increase their skill
                set
                hence increasing their productivity. We must also educate people regarding how taking short naps can
                help
                tremendously in productivity. We must start with neighborhoods and work our way forward to larger areas.

                <b>Long Term Solutions</b><br>
                The major problem is global education system and its ridgity. We must improve the way, in which people
                percieve the education system. We, as SDG warriors must inform this to the public and to the world such
                that as per country education system can be customized. While in many countries it is in practice, in
                majority countries it is not. This will result in our next generation being more productive and
                skillful.

                9 out of 10 urban people breathe polluted air.<br><br>
                <b>Solutions:</b><br>
                We as SDG warriors need to work upon ensuring that for every urban neighborhood should at least have two
                trees for
                each person. A recent study has proven that this will ensure adequate fresh air is provided to each person.
                Polluted
                Air will also be cleaned. SDG warriors can ensure this by making people aware of this topic through podcasts
                and social
                networking sites.
